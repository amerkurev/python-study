Writing your own post on the Python Study website is very easy! Here's a brief guide:

1. Clone the Python Study repository at https://github.com/amerkurev/python-study
2. Navigate to the ```content/post/``` directory
3. Create your own subdirectory and within it, create an ```index.md``` file where you can place your post (you can use any [other post as a template](https://github.com/amerkurev/python-study/tree/master/content/post))
4. Create a [Pull Request on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and submit it to us
5. We will gladly accept it!

That's it! We warmly welcome you as a co-author and valuable member of our team.
